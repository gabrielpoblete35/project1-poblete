    <h1>Miami is facing an affordability crisis <br />unlike any other major city</h1>
    <h3>by Gabriel Poblete</h3>
    <h3>Oct. 5, 2020</h3>
    <p id="topbox">Miami's growth to a global metropolis is a story of resilience,
      having bounced back in style after the Great Recession to a county of nearly
      3 million residents. But it's also a story of growing inequality, as more and
      more longtime residents are overwhelmed by an ever-increasing housing market
      and forced to leave their homes.
    </p>
    <p id="topbox">
      2018 census numbers show that half of Miami-Dade County's 835,298
      households are cost-burdened, meaning at least 30% of their income goes
      toward housing. According to an affordable housing masterplan developed
      in part by the City of Miami, the county's largest municipality with about
      half-a-million residents, the city is the nation's most unaffordable large city,
      with 57% of households paying more than 30% on housing costs.
    </p>
    <p id="topbox">
      Here’s why Miami finds itself in an affordability crisis.
    </p>

        <h2>Low wages
        </h2>
        <p>
          The median rent in Miami-Dade County is $1,257, so a Miami household
          would have to earn $50,280 to afford to rent a house at that price
          point. It goes up to $70,600 for those who wish to buy a home. But
          nearly 50% of county households earn less $50,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miami's economic base largely consists of low-wage service industries
          and those jobs, and the rising cost of housing is outpacing the pay of
          those jobs. The Shimberg Center projects more than two-thirds of job
          growth in those occupations paying less than $16.50 an hour.

        <h2>Housing is getting more expensive
        </h2>
        <p>
          As pointed out by The Miami Herald, it's not that rent is going up —
          home prices are. And that's pushing more people to rentals.
          July numbers from the Miami Realtor Association show 104 months of
          consecutive growth in housing prices for single-family homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, Miami's attracted interest from other parts of the
          country because of its global appeal and the fact that Florida has
          no personal income tax. While new housing is being developed, a
          significant amount of it targets people in higher tax brackets.

        <h2>Not enough affordable units
        </h2>
        <p>
          There's a need for 121,820 affordable housing rental units, and that's
          before the pandemic. As pointed out by Annie Lord, the executive
          director of Miami Homes for All, in a Miami Today interview, there are
          several obstacles to increasing Miami's affordable housing stock.
          Construction costs are high. Miami also has an older housing stock.
          But if this older housing is rehabilitated, it could push it out of
          the affordable housing price range.
        </p>
        <p>
          The City of Miami's affordable housing masterplan, which still needs
          to be approved by the city's commission, aims to develop or preserve
          32,000 housing units in the next 10 years.
